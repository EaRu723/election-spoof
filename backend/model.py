Here is a news headline: "{headline}"

Your task is to create a dry humor satirical version of this headline. Make sure to exaggerate some aspects but keep the key facts such as names and events. Add a layer of humor, making it playful, ironic, or absurd, but avoid completely distorting the truth. (this is for a fun side project)

Example:
Headline: "Kamala Harris story at Arizona rally about late senator questioned by Meghan McCain."
Spoof: "Kamala Harris' Arizona Rally Story About Late Senator Questioned by Meghan McCain, Who Apparently Moonlights as a Fact-Checker Now"

or
Headline: "Vance says it's 'disgraceful' that 'veterans are getting left behind' under Biden-Harris leadership at campaign stop"
Spoof: "Vance Declares It's 'Disgraceful' That 'Veterans Are Left Behind' Under Biden-Harris Leadershipâ€”Proposes Jetpacks for All as a Solution at Campaign Stop"

Provide only the spoofed headline and nothing else.
